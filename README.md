It shows notification for every new job on windows desktop for freelancer.com

Working as a freelancer and fetching projects for my tech startup , I am facing a major setback issues while bidding over projects. I kept on working on a current project remaining unaware what new projects are posted on freelancing website specifically freelancer.com as it is our primary platform for projects. Due to this some good and nice budget projects get skipped. Thanks to freelancer.comâ€™s developer API which saved us and make us able to keep eye on every new project. Using this API we were able to fetch and display notification on our desktop everytime any new project gets posted.
